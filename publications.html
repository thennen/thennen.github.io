These memory units, called ReRAM devices, behave in complex and unpredictable ways, which makes them hard to model.

Synaptogen is fast and statistically realistic—over 100× faster than previous detailed models—making it possible to simulate large neuromorphic systems.

                                    We figured out how to precisely grow the oxide material in next-generation memory devices to make them switch more gradually and reliably. To do this, we developed a high-speed testing method that analyzed millions of switching cycles, helping us pinpoint the exact conditions needed for the analog behavior that is essential for brain-inspired computing.

                                    <p><b>Finding the Sweet Spot for Brain-Like Memory</b></p><br><p>For computers to work more like the human brain, they need components that can change their resistance in a smooth, analog way, not just flipping between on and off. A key challenge with these components, called memristors, is that they tend to switch too abruptly and unreliably. We tackled this by systematically studying how different fabrication conditions affect device performance. We developed a powerful 'full factorial' testing method that let us rapidly test 2,500 unique control settings in a single ten-second measurement, gathering a massive dataset of over a million switching events per device type.</p><br><p>Our analysis revealed that creating the oxide at a lower temperature (250°C vs. 300°C) produced a device with a slightly higher internal series resistance. This small change, combined with a milder electrical characteristic, was the key to preventing the abrupt, uncontrolled switching that plagues these devices.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>This work provides a clear recipe for building more reliable memristors for analog computing. By fine-tuning the bottom-up growth of the oxide, we can create devices that switch gradually and predictably, which is a critical step toward building powerful and efficient neuromorphic systems. Furthermore, our high-speed factorial analysis method gives researchers a powerful new tool to quickly and thoroughly evaluate and optimize other new materials and device designs, accelerating progress in the field.</p>

                                    <p><b>A Robust Switch, Even When Thin</b></p><br><p>Certain advanced materials, known as Mott insulators, have the unique ability to switch from an electrical insulator to a metal when pressure is applied, making them exciting candidates for new types of electronic devices. A major question, however, was whether this useful property would survive when the material was made into an ultra-thin film, as required for all modern electronics. We answered this by performing the first direct electrical measurements of this transition in films of chromium-doped V₂O₃ as thin as 10 nanometers, using a special high-pressure chamber.</p><br><p>Our measurements revealed a dramatic change in resistance of nearly 100 times, proving that the pressure-driven switching effect is incredibly robust, even in these imperfect, polycrystalline films. To understand this better, we developed a simulation that modeled the film as a network of tiny crystal grains, each with a slightly different transition pressure. This model showed that the behavior we measured is perfectly consistent with the ideal bulk material, just averaged across the device.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>This work confirms that the fundamental switching property of this material is not lost in the ultra-thin, imperfect films that are used in real-world applications. This is a critical finding because it validates the material's potential for device fabrication. Our simulations further show that despite the material's inherent grain-to-grain variability, devices can be reliably scaled down to at least 50 nanometers in size without suffering from excessive performance variations. This gives us the confidence needed to pursue this promising material for future nanoelectronic systems.</p>

                                    We designed a new type of memory device where we build tiny 10-nanometer 'walls' around the conductive filament to keep it from changing shape. This physical confinement makes the device significantly more stable and reliable, which is a critical step for building next-generation, brain-inspired computers.

                                    <p><b>Putting Walls Around Memory</b></p><br><p>One of the biggest hurdles for using memristors in new computing hardware is their reliability. The tiny conductive filaments that store information inside these devices are prone to random fluctuations, causing performance issues. The conventional way to shrink these devices is to simply make the electrodes smaller, but this doesn't stop the filament itself from changing its shape or position. To solve this, we took a new approach: instead of just scaling the electrodes, we scaled the active oxide material itself.</p><br><p>We developed a 'nano-fin' fabrication process that physically confines the switching oxide to a 10 nm wide strip, effectively building walls around the filament and limiting its ability to spread out. We then ran a massive electrical analysis, stressing the devices with 100,000 specially modulated cycles to test their performance under 2,500 unique conditions.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>By physically controlling the filament's geometry, we directly attack a root cause of unreliability. Our measurements show that this confinement leads to a 50% decrease in the variability when writing to the device and a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio, making the device more stable and predictable. This concept of 'oxide scaling'—controlling the filament environment itself—is a major step beyond simple 'electrode scaling' and demonstrates a powerful new direction for engineering the robust and reliable hardware needed for the future of AI.</p>

                                    We discovered that the electrical switching observed in devices made from amorphous (non-crystalline) materials is actually caused by a two-step process. An initial high-voltage pulse first creates a tiny crystalline filament within the material, and then a well-understood thermal effect within that newly formed filament causes the actual switching.

                                    <p><b>A Crystal Hiding in Plain Sight</b></p><br><p>To be compatible with modern chip manufacturing, it's highly desirable to use electronic materials that can be deposited at room temperature. This process, however, usually creates an amorphous or non-crystalline structure. While devices made from amorphous chromium-doped V₂O₃ showed promising electrical switching behavior, the physical reason behind it was a mystery. We investigated this by fabricating and testing devices with different material compositions.</p><br><p>Our experiments revealed that an initial, one-time high-voltage pulse, known as a 'forming step,' is required to activate the switching. We demonstrated that this step causes a permanent physical change: the intense local heat from the current crystallizes a small, conductive filament within the otherwise amorphous material. The repeatable on-off switching observed afterward is not a property of the amorphous bulk, but is actually a 'thermal runaway' effect—a rapid self-heating process—that occurs only within this newly formed crystalline filament.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>This work clarifies the true origin of switching in these promising devices, showing that we are creating a crystal filament 'in-place'. This understanding is crucial for engineering better devices. Using a model that accurately describes the thermal process, we were able to show exactly how changing the chromium and oxygen content affects the switching voltage and leakage current. This provides a clear, physics-based guide for optimizing the material composition to create devices with the ideal performance for practical applications, like selector elements in next-generation memory arrays.</p>

However, it's notoriously difficult to work with. Depending on how it's made, its electrical resistance can vary by billions of times, and researchers often struggle to get the highly insulating version that is most desirable. To solve this, we took a more rigorous approach than the usual trial-and-error method.</p><br><p>We used a statistical method called 'design of experiments' to test a wide range of sputtering parameters—like temperature, pressure, and gas mixtures. We then used a machine learning technique called cluster analysis to sort the resulting films into four distinct groups based on their structural and electrical properties. This allowed us to clearly see which settings produced which type of film and, most importantly, to identify the optimal recipe for the one we wanted.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>This work provides a clear, reliable, and scientifically-backed recipe for making high-quality insulating NiO thin films. We found that the key is to use a high deposition temperature to create a dense film, an oxygen-rich atmosphere to make it smooth, and a final annealing step to remove excess oxygen and achieve high resistance. By identifying the most critical parameters and their interactions, we've taken the guesswork out of the process.

                                    <b>Making sense of the microscopic world</b><br><br>Imagine trying to understand a chemical reaction by looking at individual molecules. Scientists use powerful tools like scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) to take pictures of these incredibly small worlds. But a single image can contain hundreds of molecules of various types, and traditionally, researchers had to count and categorize them by hand. This manual process is slow, tedious, and limits the complexity of the questions we can ask.<br><br>To solve this, we created a smart, automated tool using Python. Our software analyzes STM images, identifies each molecule, and then sorts them into different categories based on their unique features, like shape and size. It’s designed to be easy to use right out of the box, even for those who aren't programming experts.<br><br><b>Why does this matter?</b><br><br>This work makes studying chemical reactions at the molecular level faster and more powerful. By automating the counting process, our tool frees up scientists to tackle bigger datasets and explore more subtle statistical trends. This can lead to new discoveries in on-surface chemistry and materials science. Because the software is open-source, the scientific community can freely use, modify, and improve it, helping to accelerate research for everyone.

                                    <p><strong>Testing next-generation memory and logic devices is tricky—especially when they behave in unstable or unpredictable ways.</strong><br>This paper introduces a custom-built measurement circuit that helps researchers explore these challenging behaviors more safely and accurately. It adds a programmable resistance into the test setup, giving precise control over the electrical environment around a device.</p><br>

<p>Why is this needed? Devices like ReRAM and other nanoscale components often show something called <em>negative differential resistance</em>—a kind of behavior where current can decrease even as voltage increases. This can lead to runaway effects, damaging the device or corrupting the data. Our solution uses a digitally controlled resistor (called a digipot) that can switch between 528 resistance levels and capture fast electrical signals without distorting them.</p><br>

<p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong><br>Being able to safely and accurately measure unstable device behaviors is crucial for building reliable new computing technologies. Our circuit gives scientists a flexible, computer-controlled way to test a wide variety of devices—including those used in neuromorphic computing—while minimizing unwanted noise and measurement errors. It also helps explore how different test conditions affect device performance, making it easier to design smarter electronics from the ground up.</p><br>

                                    We used high-powered x-rays to look inside a special electronic material as it switched from an insulator to a metal. We found that the conductive path it creates is not chemically different but is physically squeezed, which is direct evidence that the switching is caused by a true Mott transition.

                                    <p><b>Squeezing Atoms with Electricity</b></p><br><p>Mott insulators are a special class of materials that can be flipped from an insulating to a conducting state with an electric field, which makes them very interesting for new kinds of electronics. However, the exact reason for this useful switching behavior has been heavily debated. Was it a chemical change, like oxygen atoms moving around, or was it a more fundamental electronic effect tied to the material itself?</p><br><p>To answer this, we used a combination of powerful experimental techniques, including micro x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, to look directly at the atomic structure of the material as it switched. This allowed us to map the crystal lattice of the tiny conductive filament that forms when an electric pulse is applied.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>Our experiments revealed that the filament is structurally compressed, with a smaller unit cell volume than the surrounding insulating material. This is the exact same structural 'fingerprint' that appears when this material is turned into a metal by applying immense physical pressure. This provides the first direct proof that the electrical switching is caused by a genuine, bandwidth-controlled Mott transition, not a simple chemical reaction. This fundamental insight clarifies how these devices work and strengthens their potential for use in a new generation of advanced electronics.</p>

                                    <p><b>Taming the Runaway Switch</b></p><br><p>A new class of electronic components, called resistive switches, are key for future technologies like advanced computer memory (RRAM) and neuromorphic (brain-like) computers. A major problem is that these tiny switches are very delicate. When they turn on, they can experience a sudden, uncontrolled surge of current that instantly destroys them. The standard solution is to build a protective transistor right next to each switch on the chip, but this is complicated and slows down research and development.</p><br><p>We created an external circuit, a Current Limiting Amplifier (CLA), that solves this problem without needing on-chip modifications. It sits between the testing equipment and the device, allowing the switch to operate normally but instantly clamping down on any destructive current surges. Our design is fast, stable, and minimizes electrical noise, preventing the 'overshoots' that plague commercial testing equipment and can damage the devices.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>This new amplifier allows us to test resistive switches at incredible speeds—we demonstrated collecting 100,000 full switching cycles in just one second. That's about a million times faster than standard lab equipment. This high speed makes it practical to gather the massive amounts of statistical data needed to understand the unreliable nature of these devices and figure out how to make them better.

                                    <p><b>Teaching Tiny Oscillators to Think</b></p><br><p>Modern artificial intelligence is incredibly powerful, but training and running AI models can consume a tremendous amount of energy. To tackle this, we are exploring new types of computer hardware that take inspiration from the efficiency of the human brain. We focused on a concept called 'reservoir computing,' which is a type of neural network that is very fast to train.</p><br><p>Our approach uses a unique electronic device based on a material called a Mott insulator (specifically, Cr-doped V₂O₃). When placed in a simple circuit, this device naturally starts to oscillate, producing electrical spikes that closely resemble the 'leaky-integrate-and-fire' behavior of biological neurons. We used an array of these simple, neuron-like circuits to form the 'reservoir'—the dynamic and complex core of our computing system.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>Using these physical neuron-like circuits, we created a system that can learn and perform complex tasks with remarkable efficiency. We successfully demonstrated its ability to recognize spoken words and handwritten digits with an accuracy that rivals much larger, more complex AI models like LSTMs. Crucially, our system achieves this with a tiny fraction of the power and a significantly faster processing speed compared to running the same tasks on a CPU, GPU, or FPGA. This work shows a promising path toward building powerful, low-energy hardware for fast, on-device AI applications.</p>

                                    We figured out exactly how a certain type of next-gen memory device works by storing multiple resistance levels. The secret is a tiny energy barrier at the metal contact that gets wider or narrower to control how easily electrons can pass through.

                                    <p><b>How Electrons Cross the Barrier</b></p><br><p>To build computers that work more like the brain, we need memory components that can store a whole range of values, not just a simple '0' or '1'. We looked closely at a promising device made of Strontium Titanate (SrTiO₃) to understand how it achieves this analog behavior. We ran a series of experiments, measuring the device's electrical properties at different temperatures and for various resistance states.</p><br><p>To explain what we saw, we built a detailed computer simulation. The model showed that the device's resistance is controlled by a thin energy barrier that forms right where the oxide meets the metal electrode.

For electrons to get across, they need enough thermal energy to get close and then 'tunnel' through the rest of the way.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>This work pins down the precise physics of how these analog memory devices operate. By understanding that everything comes down to tuning this tunnel barrier, engineers now have a clear target for improvement. It gives them the fundamental knowledge needed to design more precise, stable, and reliable analog memory, which is a key component for building future neuromorphic computers.</p>

                                    We developed a new measurement technique to find out just how fast next-generation memory devices can switch. Using this method, we were able to clock switching speeds down to 50 picoseconds—that's the time it takes light to travel less than an inch.

Existing methods struggle to measure switching events that happen faster than a nanosecond. We developed a new experimental setup that uses a specialized pulse generator and advanced statistical analysis to precisely determine switching times on a picosecond timescale (trillionths of a second). We used this method to compare the top speeds of two promising memory materials, Tantalum Oxide (TaOₓ) and Zirconium Oxide (ZrOₓ).</p><br><p>By applying thousands of extremely short electrical pulses and measuring the result of each one, we could pinpoint exactly how long it takes for a device to flip from a high to a low resistance state.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>Our technique allowed us to measure memory switching in as little as 50 picoseconds, with the actual resistance transition taking less than 15 picoseconds—the fastest ever reported for these kinds of devices. We also found that ZrOₓ switches faster than TaOₓ at the same voltage, which is likely due to the lower energy needed to move oxygen atoms in that material. This work provides a vital tool for discovering and comparing the true speed of new memory materials, which helps direct research toward the fastest possible technologies.</p>

                                    <p><b>Looks Can Be Deceiving</b></p><br><p>When studying new memory devices, researchers often use current-voltage (I-V) curves to see how they switch. A certain feature—a constant voltage during the 'ON' switch—is often seen in non-volatile memory and is typically explained by a conductive filament inside the device growing wider. The issue is, we've observed this exact same feature in a completely different, volatile type of switch (Cr-doped V₂O₃). This raises an important question: do they really work the same way just because their I-V curves look alike?</p><br><p>This paper reviews the common models and highlights this potential pitfall. We argue that very different physical mechanisms can actually produce very similar-looking electrical signatures. For instance, the behavior in the volatile switch might be better explained by a thermal effect within a filament of a *fixed* size, rather than one that changes its width.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>This work serves as an important check on a common assumption in the field of resistive memory. It shows that relying only on I-V curves to identify a device's internal switching mechanism can be misleading. To truly understand and improve these complex devices, it is essential to use more advanced characterization methods to get the full picture. Getting the physics right is a necessary step to correctly model and ultimately optimize these devices for future technologies.</p>

                                    <p><b>Better Magnets Through Baking</b></p><br><p>One of the most promising ways to create next-generation hard drives is 'bit-patterned media,' where data is stored on billions of tiny, physically separated magnetic islands. A major challenge is that the process used to etch these islands can damage their edges, which hurts performance and reliability. We investigated a simple but powerful solution: what if we just bake the disk in a vacuum after the islands are made?</p><br><p>We took a disk with a density of one trillion dots per square inch (1 Tdot/in²) and annealed it at 400°C. The results were dramatic. The coercivity (a measure of magnetic robustness) more than doubled, and the thermal stability—the ability to resist being erased by heat—increased by a massive 3-fold.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>This post-annealing process does more than just fix damage. Our analysis revealed it kicks off a chemical reaction where the chromium atoms in the alloy migrate from the center of each island to the edges. This creates an ideal structure: a highly stable, high-performance magnetic core surrounded by a protective, non-magnetic shell. This discovery provides a straightforward and highly effective method for fabricating the top-quality, ultra-dense media required for the hard drives of the future.</p>

                                    When writing to a single magnetic island on a patterned hard drive, stray magnetic fields from the surroundings can cause errors.

                                    <p><b>The Problem with Small Grains</b></p><br><p>The main way to increase hard drive capacity is to shrink the magnetic grains that store each bit of data. But there's a catch. As the grains get smaller, the non-magnetic boundaries between them also get thinner, which can cause them to become too strongly coupled. When this happens, they stop acting like individual bits and instead behave like large 'magnetic clusters,' which increases the media noise and makes it harder to read and write data reliably.</p><br><p>We analyzed various types of magnetic media with different grain sizes and levels of internal magnetic coupling. We measured the 'magnetic cluster size' to see how these groups of grains behave as the physical grain size shrinks.</p><br><p><b>Why does this matter?</b></p><br><p>Our analysis identified a critical 'knee' in this behavior: for highly coupled media, the magnetic cluster size suddenly shoots up when the physical grains get smaller than about 8 nanometers, hurting the drive's signal-to-noise ratio. By using media with lower internal coupling, we can push this problematic knee down to even smaller grain sizes.
